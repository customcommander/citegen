## About

This package contains the entire test suite from the `citation-style-language/test-suite` project converted to Gherkin.

There is one `.feature` file for each `.txt` file found in the `processor-tests/humans`
directory of the `citation-style-language/test-suite` project.

## Installation

NPM

`npm install @customcommander/csl-features-std`

Yarn

`yarn add @customcommander/csl-features-std`

Features files will be available in the `dist` folder.

## Development

This package depends on the `citation-style-language/test-suite` project which is a Git submodule of this repository. (Cf. `vendor/test-suite`.)

| Make target      | Comment                                             |
|:-----------------|:----------------------------------------------------|
| `make`           | Alias for `make dist README.md`                     |
| `make dist`      | Generate the `dist` folder from `vendor/test-suite` |
| `make clean`     | Delete the `dist` folder                            |
| `make README.md` | Keeps `README.md` up to date with `dist/*.feature`  |

## Text To Gherkin Conversion

The content of the `>>===== MODE =====>>` section becomes a "mode" tag.

The first part of the filename becomes a "feature" tag. The second part becomes the name of the feature.

Example: `affix_CommaAfterQuote.txt`

```
>>===== MODE =====>>
citation
<<===== MODE =====<<

...
```

```gherkin
@citation @affix
Feature: CommaAfterQuote

...
```

Each opening section (except for the `MODE` section) corresponds to a Gherkin step.

Everything between the opening and the closing of a section is passed as a Doc String.

Example:

```
>>===== CSL =====>>
<style>
  <!-- some style -->
</style>
<<===== CSL =====<<
```

```gherkin
Given the following citation style
  """
  <style>
    <!-- some style -->
  </style>
  """
```

A feature file always starts with the `CSL` section and ends with the `RESULT` section.

Example: `example_HelloWorld.feature`

```gherkin
@citation @example
Feature: HelloWorld

Scenario:
Given the following citation style
  """
  <style>
    <!-- ... -->
  </style>
  """
# ...
# (some additional steps here)
# ...
Then the following result is expected
  """
  Some citation
  """
```
